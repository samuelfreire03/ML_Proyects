# Machine Learning Python Project

This project is a machine learning application that aims to provide insights and predictions based on the provided dataset. The project is structured to facilitate data processing, model training, evaluation, and exploratory data analysis.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the datasets used in the project.
  - **raw/**: Directory for raw data files.
  - **processed/**: Directory for processed data files that are cleaned and transformed for model training.

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for analysis.
  - **exploratory_analysis.ipynb**: Notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations and insights.

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the project.
  - **__init__.py**: Marks the src directory as a Python package.
  - **data_preprocessing.py**: Functions for loading and preprocessing data, including cleaning and normalization.
  - **model.py**: Defines the machine learning model architecture or algorithm.
  - **train.py**: Handles model training, fitting the model to the training data, and saving the trained model.
  - **evaluate.py**: Functions for evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for the project.
  - **__init__.py**: Marks the tests directory as a Python package.
  - **test_model.py**: Unit tests for the functions and classes defined in model.py.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project, including libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and possibly TensorFlow or PyTorch.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git, such as compiled Python files and Jupyter notebook checkpoints.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd ml-python-project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- To perform exploratory data analysis, open the Jupyter notebook located in the `notebooks/` directory.
- Use the scripts in the `src/` directory to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate their performance.
